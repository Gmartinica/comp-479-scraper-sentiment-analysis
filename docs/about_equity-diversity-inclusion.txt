OUR WORK TOWARDS EQUITY, DIVERSITY & INCLUSION

Mission statementThe Gina Cody School is committed to advancing equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) in classrooms, research labs and across industry. Systemic barriers do not fix themselves. Awareness needs to be backed up by deliberate actions—early encouragement, mentorship, scholarships, hiring and promotions. We acknowledge and actively support Concordia University’s efforts towards achieving a more equitable, diverse and inclusive environment.

We are a community of students, faculty and administrative services. To work towards achieving equity, diversity and inclusion throughout the School, it is important that we adopt a shared vision and embrace the same values.READ THE SCHOOL'S VISIONAWARDS & GRANTS
