Continuous Improvement Process (CIP)



Continuous Improvement Process is the ongoing systematic observation and evaluation of the current system to identify and resolve problems to deliver the best learning environment to GCS students. Faculty members can find ongoing works related to CIP and various support documents from the Accreditation Resource Pages.







Graduate Attribute Assessment System (GAAS)











The Graduate Attribute Assessment System (GAAS) web application enables the recording of graduate attribute assessment as required by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board. For the purposes of the AAS system, each term, every department assigns a set of courses that measure graduate attributes. These courses are said to participate in the AAS system. For each participating course, the department specifies which attributes are assessed in that course.
Please watch the video above for the GAAS upload instructions.
